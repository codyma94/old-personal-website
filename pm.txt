How NOT to be a Project Manager, by an Intern
=============================================

In the summer of my sophomore year, I was lucky to land an internship in the Boston area that promised extremely interesting work and amazing team to do it with. When I interviewed there, I was excited by how enthusiastic the team was, and how knowledgeable they all were in their field of expertise. The interview questions they asked me were really fun to work out, and I ultimately turned down an offer with higher pay to work with them. Unfortunately for me, as with any startup, the team moved quickly, and between the time I was hired and the time I started there, a project manager was hired to, well, manage the team. I say unfortunately because I had a terrible experience with him, and as I had no opportunity to during my time there, I will provide some constructive criticism to him (and maybe to other project managers) through this blog post.

Thinks he is better than everyone else at everything
----------------------------------------------------
Speaks for itself I guess - maybe expand later


Shit on every resume you see
----------------------------------------
Laugh about the libraries the person uses (they use PHP? They worked with Rails? "we judge people really hard for using rails")

Is it really necessary to remind me that I am an intern... Every day?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
During my time there, the company was aggressively expanding, and as a result, I saw lots of interviewees come and go. Since we have a small office, he would walk the interviewee through, and introduce everyone to him/her. Every now and then, when he got to me, he would say "This is our intern. He doesn't have a name. We just call him intern."

Get a different chair, intern. You are sitting on my chair.


You can use Twitter... But only if you are Tweeting about the company.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
I was told this in a one-on-one meeting with him and I didn't really understand the logic behind this one. He claims to be okay with his developers using Reddit, Hacker News, Facebook, etc., but when it comes to Tweeting, the Tweet must be related to the company. This one probably annoyed me more than it should have, because I like to use Twitter just as a massive brain dump. When I have a random though, I will Tweet it. I don't want to filter my Tweets to satisfy you - that is not why my Twitter account exists, asshole.


You should not have any opinions. You are 19. Do not have opinions.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
I also didn't quite understand this one. I could understand if he was asking me as a young person to not have opinions that are set in stone, but to not have opinions at all, really? He went on to say that if I think something is done poorly, like a function in an external library or a snippet of code, don't voice your opinion that you think it's done badly, ask someone why it was done. Voicing your opinion will make other people notice, and everyone else their is very perceptive. You don't want them to perceive the wrong thing about you. So pretty much, you're saying that I can't analyze other code without being judged?


Don't ask for my honest opinion, then yell at me for giving it to you
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This one was great. At a weekly meeting, he asked everyone to give their honest opinion on how our daily standups were going, and to offer up any suggestions if we had any. I didn't really present anything myself, but chimed in in agreement when one of my coworkers voiced concerns that they were too long and not very useful. After this, in a one on one meeting with my PM, I was given grief for having a bad attitude about the standups, and how he never wants to hear any of that again.


Don't give me bad instructions, then blame me when I follow them.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Weekly standups should be a brief summary and then talk about any blockers you might have ==> WTF man why you give brief summary???


Do the math
-----------
Worked for 7.5 hours, asked me to bump it up, go to 8.5 hours. Tell me he doesn't want me to work > 40 hours a week, but wants me to stay later and come earlier?!?!


Value time in the office more than productivity
-----------------------------------------------
We don't care how much you produce, you're an intern. We just want you to show that you care by staying in the office longer


Stop threatening me.
--------------------
We could give you the worst referral ever.


Stop pretending to be the good guy. Because you're not.
-------------------------------------------------------
Listen, you're lucky. I could just fire you for not working 8 hour days. But I'm going to give you a second chance.
Listen, you're lucky. The previous project manager would have been all over you're ass. But I'm not like that. I'll give you space.
Listen, you're lucky. You get to do whatever you want. Lots of companies don't let interns do whatever they want. But we're not about that.
Listen, you're lucky. I could just look through your internet history and see what you've been doing. But I won't do that.
